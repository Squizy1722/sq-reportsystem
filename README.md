I wanted to create a server but it didn't go like I wanted so I give my code for free
this code is little old so I hope all is good and don't have any problems
# command
/report [Reason] | /adminsit [ID] | /endsit
# you need to change the qb-log webhook link to make the logs work
# little info about the resource
(1)its a good report system to reduce the admin abuse | (2)you can change the report cooldown in the config.lua | (3)2 admins cannot teleport to the same player | (4)admin cannot teleport to another player before he ending the report | (5)admin cannot teleport player without the player sending a report |
